# Full Projects

These are full, working projects that illustrate how to accomplish a specific workflow or outcome.

When possible, try to make all Cinder Blocks copied rather than relative to the project. This way projects can be built/run regardless of where the user locally clones the repo.

**In each project folder**:
Include any needed assets and try to comment key portions of the functionality that is intended to be shown.
