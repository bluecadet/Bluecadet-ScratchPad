# Snippets

These are methods or a few lines of code that are easy enough to copy/paste to accomplish a specific task or do some helpful math. 

**In each snippet folder**:
Code can be broken into .cpp/.h files, a txt file, or placed directly into the readme if its compact enough.

Be sure to explain what the snippet does and how to use it. A simple use case example can be very helpful.
