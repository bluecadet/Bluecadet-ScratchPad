# Classes

Modular classes/objects that can [relatively] easily be dragged and dropped into a project. 

**In each class folder**:
Include any .cpp/.h files for the core contribution and whenever possible, any base/parent classes.
Include a readme that explains what the class does and a simple explanation of how to implement.
