# Bluecadet-ScratchPad
Repository for helpful bits of code developed by cadets over time.

## Purpose
This repository is an attempt to collect all the useful bits of specialized code created during the development of larger projects. Helpful tools, classes and methods that came in handy but arent quite general enough to be folded into Bluecadet's internal libraries.

## Style guide
Clean and simple. Don't worry too much about making code pretty, but its function should be clear and should be relatively readable.

## Repo Structure


**CINDER**

Depending on what you'd like to contribute, it most likely will fit into one of the following three categories:

- **Full Project** - full Cinder projects that demonstrate a workflow/functionality
- **Classes** - A modular class or object that's easy to use/reuse for specific tasks
- **Snippets** - A few lines of code for simple tasks, helpful math, etc.

Each individual contribution should contain its own "README.md" file with a simple explanation of what the contribution does and how to implement it. Whenever possible, try to include (or at least list) any dependencies or needed assets.

**WEB**

Needs further development! Open to suggestions...
